# Eunomia
Eunomia is a project being developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in collaboration with
Matthew Weber and John Capozzo. The project aims to answer two questions. First, are mutation transition probabilities
indiciative of known cancer subtypes and can they be used to find more distinct cancer subtypes? Second, can the MDMR
algorithm effectively pick out features to increase the predictive power of deep neural networks.

## Methods
We are utilizing Google's TensorFlow dataflow graph framework to construct a stacked autoencoder. Each hidden layer
of the neural network undergoes unsupervised training in a greedy layer-by-layer progression with each decoding layer
being thrown away as successive hidden layers are trained. The output layer is currently being trained using supervised
learning but the eventual goal is to perform unsupervised multi-label classification on the given data to elucidate
hidden subtypes in the cancer data.

## Unsupervised Learning
The amount of unlabeled data is orders of magnitude larger than that of labeled data. Additionally the process of
labeling data is time-consuming and expensive. It also requires that the user know what they are looking for or have
a large number of real life examples before which defeats the feature finding power of deep neural networks.

## Usage
	python eunomia.py <path to csv file>

Only works with CSV files. In the CSV file, Eunomia treats each row as a sample and each column as a feature.
